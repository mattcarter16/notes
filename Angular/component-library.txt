Create Component Library

	1. Install ng-packagr
	2. Install tsickle
	3. Create public_api.ts file (under package.json file)
	4. Add exports  (export * from './src/app/services/auth-guard.service';)
	5. Add ng-package.json file 
	6. Add npm script in json file ("ng-packagr -p ng-package.json")
	7. Update version in package.json - 'npm version (patch/minor/major)'
	8. In terminal run 'npm run packagr' - new dist folder created
	9. CD into dist folder and in terminal run 'npm pack' - this creates a tarball file (sp-extension-0.0.1.tgz)
	
	

Update Component Library
	
	1. Add export in public_api.ts file
	2. Update version in package.json - 'npm version (patch/minor/major)'
	3. In terminal run 'npm run packagr' - new dist folder created
	4. CD into dist folder and in terminal run 'npm pack' - this creates a tarball file (sp-extension-0.0.1.tgz)
	5. If this is not in a current app - in the app run 'npm install C:\se_tfs2017npm pack\SharePoint\_Shared\sp-extension\dist\sp-extension-0.0.1.tgz (this will change with version changes)
	6. If this is already in the app - update the version of the package in package.json file of app and run 'npm install'
